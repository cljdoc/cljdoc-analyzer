// Note: release workflow automatically updates "unreleased" headers in this file
= Changelog

// Release workflow will:
// - Fail when:
//   - there is no "== Unreleased" section header
//   - or the section contains no descriptive text
// - Replace the Unreleased section header with actual release version
// - Prepend a new Unreleased section header
